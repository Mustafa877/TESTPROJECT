## Project API with Vuetify
 
This project, API, uses the Vuetify framework to manage a JSON list of posts. The goal is to implement CRUD functionality and save the data in local storage. You can view the project live [here](https://mustafa-vf-project.netlify.app/).

 ##


This is the official scaffolding tool for Vuetify, designed to give you a head start in building your new Vuetify application. It sets up a base template with all the necessary configurations and standard directory structure, enabling you to begin development without the hassle of setting up the project from scratch.
## üíø Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager       | Command        |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| yarn                  | `yarn install` |
| npm                   | `npm install`  |
| pnpm                  | `pnpm install` |
| bun                   | `bun install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.

## üí° Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server with hot-reload. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
npm dev
```

(Use the respective commands for npm, pnpm, and bun.)

To suppress JSON import warnings, add `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings'`. For Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, use `NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'`. Alternatively, you can remove this option from your package.json dev script if you don't mind the warnings.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm build
```

(Use the respective commands for npm, pnpm, and bun.)

After the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment.
